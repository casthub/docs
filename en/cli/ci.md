Since the CastHub CLI can act as a headless CLI tool, it is possible to use it in a CI/CD integration to automate the uploading and/or publishing of content to the CastHub Ecosystem.

## GitHub Actions

We have an official GitHub Action for setting-up and authorizing the CastHub CLI for GitHub Actions. You can find it [here](https://github.com/casthub/cli-github-action) along with documentation on usage.

## Other CI/CD

For any CI/CD systems not listed on this page, we don't have any official images/procedures. If you would like to contribute or request a specific integration, feel free to let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XMrHXtN).
